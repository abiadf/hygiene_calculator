This project deals with the cleaning of the Astronaut milking robots.

After milking, the Astronaut contains some residual milk, which needs to be cleaned periodically. A series of actions are performed to ensure the cleaning of the robot is hygienic.

This project takes the characteristics of the robots' cleaning and based on that, tries to estimate how hygienic said cleaning was.
