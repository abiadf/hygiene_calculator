# Milking Cleaning Project

There are efforts to sanitize the Astronaut milking robot tubing, using a solution composed of a chemical detergent mixed with water. The data comes as csv files from a bunch of sensors, which we have to make sense of.

This project is divided into 2 parts, the first part dealing with automating and calculating the cleaning process, and the second part estimating the cleaning process, as we will not always have access to data.

For more info, it is advised to visit the `docs` section, which contains a readme for each sub-project.
